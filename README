This is the node_gce module.

Developers:

To get your environment setup to be able to run specs:

 - clone and/or update git checkouts of puppet and facter
 - switch to puppet branch 2.7.12
 - switch to facter branch 1.6.9
 - ENVPUPPET_BASEDIR=~/git; export ENVPUPPET_BASEDIR
 - . ~/git/puppet/ext/envpuppet
 - RUBYLIB="${RUBYLIB}:${HOME}/git/puppetlabs-node_gce/lib"; export RUBYLIB
 - gem install rspec mocha
 - create a Google Compute project
 - Authorize API access (project name: "Puppet Cloud Provisioner")
 - create a client ID for an "installed application"
 - run bin/credentials_builder.rb specifying that output should go to spec/fixtures/credentials.yml  (conversely, to ~/.fog if you want to use those credentials outside of testing)
 - make a spec/fixtures/project.yml (see spec/fixtures/project.yml-example for format) with your project name in it
 - rspec spec
